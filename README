This package contains the source materials (code/art/script) for the English
translation project for the Famicom game Sanma no Meitantei.

                    ****************************************
                    
The build system is only set up for Unix-like systems, though none of the code
is fundamentally dependent on this and could be ported with a bit of effort.
You'll need GCC.

Get a ROM image of the original game. This should be the No-Intro verified dump
("Sanma no Mei Tantei (Japan).nes") with an iNES header; the MD5 sum should be
002f464f224ccbed94427686815ab68b. Rename it "sanma.nes" and place it in the
"sanma" folder. Then:

$ cd sanma
$ ./build.sh

build.sh should then build all the necessary tools and output the translated
ROM as sanma_en.nes.

If you want to modify the project, check build.sh to see where the resources
that get inserted into the game are coming from.

See COPYING. Basically, everything by me (Supper) is GPLv3, and everything else
is under the terms of whoever wrote it.
